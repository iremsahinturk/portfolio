          We created a mental model by analyzing user behavior across three key stages:
          <br/>
          <br/>
          <span className='font-semibold'>Before purchase:</span> 
          &nbsp;What motivates them to buy, how they stay informed about Mavi and its discounts,
          <br/>
          <span className='font-semibold'>During purchase:</span> 
          &nbsp;People, events, or situations that influence them; how they describe the products; how they search for items they like; size selection; jean models and product features,
          <br/>
          <span className='font-semibold'>After purchase:</span> 
          &nbsp;How they style the product, and their experiences with return and exchange processes.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          Based on these insights, we developed a total of&nbsp;
          <span className='underline underline-offset-4 decoration-[0.12rem] decoration-red-500'>130 design recommendations</span>
          &nbsp;across all user groups.
